/* Protocol:
   1) The client connects to the host.
      - Only one client is supported at any one time.
   2) The host transmits a struct NS_Header, which reports
      configuration information to the client.
   3) The host waits for commands.
   4) The client issues such commands.
   5) The host responds.
   6) After the client has sent a START command, the host will send
      DATA frames, until it receives a STOP command or something
      goes badly wrong.
   7) End of recording is marked by sending an INFO frame.
   8) This INFO frame contains a "reason" field that tells the client
      whether the frame was sent spontaneously (host side run
      termination), in response to a STOP command (client side run
      termination), or in response to a GETINFO command.
      This is important, because of a possible race condition: suppose
      the client sends a STOP command, and the host experiences an
      error condition before it has replied. It will terminate the run
      in response to that error condition, and send an INFO frame. A
      little while later, it receives the STOP command, and sends
      another INFO frame. Now the client, if unaware of this, would be
      expecting only one INFO frame. It would then leave the second
      INFO frame on the stream, to be read at the next run. At that
      point, the client would incorrectly conclude that that run ended
      immediately.
   9) The client closes the connection.
